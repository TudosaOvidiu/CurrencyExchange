# Currency Exchange App

The entry point of the aplications is from the point of view of an user with 3 accounts with following balances:
  * USD: 500
  * EUR: 400
  * GBP: 300

From here you can make exchanges between diffrent currencies as long as the amount of your base currency is less than the balance for that currency.
